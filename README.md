📖 I build robust, user-friendly web applications using `Ruby on Rails` with ActiveRecord and Postgres on the backend, usually paired with `Svelte` and `SvelteKit` on the frontend. My toolkit also includes `ElasticSearch` for powerful search functionality and `NodeJS` when the project calls for it. As much as I can, I self-host my applications.
